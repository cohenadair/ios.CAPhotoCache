                        CAPhotoCache is a very small, simple library that will manage a memory and disk cache for
                        displaying photos in different sized UIImageViews iOS. This allows for seamless, fluid UI
                        movement and user experience. CAPhotoCache was created to be used with another project of
                        mine, Anglersâ€™ Log.  No other cacheing systems works quite like I needed, and I thought
                        it might be fun to create an iOS library for others to use.
